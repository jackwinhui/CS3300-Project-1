# CS3300-Project-1

This project creates a data visualization for the most popular Marvel movies by creating a line graph with two aligned channels, one along the x-axis that shows time and the different “phases” of the MCU and one along the y-axis that will show the amount of money in $USD made through box office revenue. We will also use the logo of the Marvel movies as the data points rather than simple dot points to add visual appeal and visibility. Our goal is to see if there is an upward trend in the amount of money Marvel makes in its movies over time, as box office revenue is a good indicator of the popularity of the movie itself and how many people have bought tickets to watch it. In addition, the use of logos will help provide some general indications on whether certain marvel franchises are more popular than others. 


We will use the dataset below:
